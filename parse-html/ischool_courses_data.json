While the primary case material is from the US (both state and national) the global nature of the internet means that the divergent policy trajectories of the European Union, China, and countries like India are a central theme throughout the course.",

        "description": "Biosensory computing is the multidisciplinary study and development of systems and practices that sense, represent, communicate, and interpret biological signals from the body.  Biosignals are expansive in scope, and can enable a diverse range of biosensory computing applications. They can include physiological (e.g., ECG/PPG, EDA, EEG) and kinesthetic signals (e.g., accelerometry, eye gaze, facial expressions). Many inferences can be drawn about the person from these signals, including their activities, emotional and mental states, health, and even their identities, intentions, memories, and thoughts.  While generated by the person, biosensory data have important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of user-generated data. They are intimate yet leakable, precise yet ambiguous, familiar yet unverifiable, and have limited controllability. Therefore, responsible stewardship of biosensory data must be in place before the full potential of biosensory computing can be realized.  This multidisciplinary course will explore the intellectual foundations and research advances in biosensory computing. We will survey the range of biosensing modalities and technologies, study temporal and spectral data analysis and visualization techniques, interrogate the designs of novel biosensing applications, and tackle issues of user privacy and research ethics. Students signing up for the 3-unit option will continue in the second half of the semester with a student-led research project.",

The goal of this class is to deploy a few important theories about the relationship between information and behavior, into practical settings — emphasizing the design of experiments that can now be incorporated into many 'applications' in day-to-day life. Truly 'smart systems' will have built into them precise, testable propositions about how human behavior can be modified by what the systems tell us and do for us. So let's design these experiments into our systems from the ground up! This class develops a theoretically informed, practical point of view on how to do that more effectively and with greater impact.",

Following these three main design phases, students will learn what needs assessment might look like for designing AI systems, how those systems might be prototyped, and what HCI methods for real-world evaluation can teach us about evaluating AI systems in their context of use. The course will also discuss challenges that are unique to AI systems, such as understanding and communicating technical capabilities and recognizing and recovering from errors.  Guest lectures will be given by experts in AI ethics (e.g., Timnit Gebru) and fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems (e.g., Motahhare Eslami).",

        "description": "Data and the algorithmic systems are ubiquitous in everyday life. These data encode our daily choices, actions, and behaviors, as well as our more persistent social identities. They also enrich the lives of some while limiting the life chances of others. In this way, data generated and collected about us form a type of information infrastructure: pervasive, hidden, and at times insidious. As technology and data-driven systems increasingly enter into our public, professional, and personal spheres, more of these worlds become encoded in data and result in shifts in the power relations within those worlds. In a word, data is a medium which reconfigures power.  In this seminar, we will engage readings around data, power, and infrastructure, drawing from a number of interdisciplinary academic, artistic, and activist traditions. We’ll discuss topics related to state projects of legibility and quantification; the genealogy of the modern data subject; the politics of classification systems; the surveillance of Blackness and the carceral logics of technology; administrative violence and trans and gender non-conforming identities; the invisible labor powering data-driven systems; and the resistances, obfuscations, and refusals to datafication and surveillance.",

We will first survey the vast literature on the psychology of how people arrive at judgments and make decisions with the help of statistical information, focused mostly on experimental lab evidence from cognitive and social psychology. Then we will study the burgeoning evidence on how people use statistical algorithms in practice, exploring field evidence from a range of settings from criminal justice and healthcare to housing and labor markets. We will pay special attention to psychological principles that impact the effectiveness and fairness of algorithms deployed at scale. The primary aim is to help students understand systematic human errors and explore potential algorithmic solutions.",

We then explore design, deployment, and governance practices aligned with visions of economic democracy, direct democracy, socialism, Afrofuturism, Zapatismo, and Native American sovereignties.

Applying the principles of effective storytelling to make a complex project quickly comprehensible is key. Your portfolio case studies should articulate the initial problem, synopsize the design process, explain the key decisions that moved the project forward, and highlight why the solution was appropriate. This course will include talks by several UX hiring managers who will discuss what they look for in portfolios and common mistakes to avoid.  Students should come to the course with a completed project to use as the basis for their case study; they will finish with a completed case study and repeatable process. Although this class focuses on UX, students from related fields who are expected to share examples and outcomes of past projects during the interview process (data science, product management, etc.) are welcome to join.",

In addition to looking at foundational policy such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the course traces the growth of online misinformation and disinformation, algorithmic amplification, digital advertising, large scale data collection, and growing corporate scale and power — as well as the corresponding debates about content controls, encryption, privacy protection, information security, and antitrust regulation. While the primary case material is from the US (both state and national) the global nature of the internet means that the divergent policy trajectories of the European Union, China, and countries like India are a central theme throughout the course.",

Thus, it is in our interest to better understand the socio-technical aspects of games and their role in our societies. The scope of this course includes principles and theories from social psychology, behavioral economics, information science, user interface design, as well as the art and science of game design. The course will explore questions such as: What makes a game? What are the mechanics and rules of compelling games? What is the social role of gaming in society? Why do people play? How are games used as part of storytelling? How do games build (or hinder) the development of community? How is game design different in virtual reality (VR) versus flat-screen environments? How do issues of gender, race and sexuality play out in gaming culture? What can games teach us about learning? What makes a successful, serious game? What makes a game immersive? Can games be considered art?",

We will focus on major algorithms used in NLP for various applications (part-of-speech tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, machine translation) and on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model. Students will implement algorithms and create linguistically annotated data on which those algorithms depend.",

Each week, students will complete both in-class and take-home projects that apply concepts and frameworks to real problem spaces. Class sessions will simulate professional design practice through weekly critiques, peer feedback, and design reviews. Students will be expected to present their work every week, engage actively in discussion, and refine their designs based on input.  Assignments will range from rapid, low-fidelity exercises to more developed interaction prototypes, giving students practice across the spectrum of design methods. The course culminates in a final project during the last weeks, where students bring together the skills, approaches, and insights developed throughout the semester. By the end of the course, students will have built a portfolio project and gained experience working within the collaborative, iterative culture of interaction design.",

The course ends with an examination of digital markets, blockchain technologies and ongoing concerns with digital antitrust and platform power.  Students will learn to critically examine and take a historical and theoretically informed view towards the role of markets. Students will be able to apply such framings to existing issues in digital markets, such as antitrust, control over market information, and price discrimination, across domains such as ad auctions, e-commerce and the gig economy.  This course is suitable for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in how markets are studied across different fields, and is designed to be accessible to students of all backgrounds.",

This course will include talks by several UX hiring managers who will discuss what they look for in portfolios and common mistakes to avoid.  Students should come to the course with a completed project to use as the basis for their case study; they will finish with a completed case study and repeatable process. Although this class focuses on UX, students from related fields who are expected to share examples and outcomes of past projects during the interview process (data science, product management, etc.) are welcome to join.",

        "units": 3.0,
        "description": "While often defined as “the computational study of culture”, cultural analytics might be best understood as a radical interdisciplinary experiment, one that seeks to understand cultures — socialties, histories, cognition, the literary — through empirical models and patterns, built on effective computational representations of relevant cultural constructs. This experiment calls for a unique skill set: one needs to be familiar with approaches in the interpretive humanities and computer/information science; one also needs to cultivate an interdisciplinary mindset: recognize and appreciate the affordances and limitations of both qualitative and quantitative traditions. This class is imagined as a possible point of departure for those who are so inclined.  As such, this course is all about making connections: bridging the interpretive traditions of literary and cultural studies — which guide our critical engagement with texts and cultural artifacts — with computational methods, ranging from featurized classifiers to large language models. It pursues two complementary ends: students will develop interpretive strategies and critical vocabularies for cultural analysis, and, through hands-on practice grounded in engagement and experience with the text, they will learn to represent cultural data — whether text, image, audio, or video — and train machine learning models as algorithmic measuring devices to systematically characterize cultural phenomena of interest.  This class welcomes a range of inclinations: maybe you know how to implement an RNN or Transformer from scratch but are curious whether those models can be used to study literature, culture, or something beyond positive or negative sentiments. Or, maybe you’ve experimented with off-the-shelf topic models or word embeddings to explore humanities questions and want to see how far you can take them.",

They are used in business, education, and even in physiological training and rehabilitation. While playful design primarily emulates the “look and feel”, gamification also applies some of the game mechanics. In the seminar, we will look at best practices in both areas. We will examine the models on which the current solutions are based. Psychological and cognitive aspects (e.g., motivation, task load) will also be discussed. In the second half of the seminar, we will create our own (visual) prototype of a gamified application in groups of 2-4 persons.",

Students will learn how to translate insights from these methods into a coherent vision and strategy, connect this work to a product roadmap, and effectively communicate this end-to-end process in a case study. Guest lecturers will be invited to share perspectives on how they apply the frameworks and toolkits from class in industry settings. By the end of the course, students will be well-equipped to apply systems and futures thinking within an organization to inform strategy, and build human-centered systems that benefit individuals and society.

        "description": "Biosensory computing is the multidisciplinary study and development of systems and practices that sense, represent, communicate, and interpret biological signals from the body.  Biosignals are expansive in scope, and can enable a diverse range of biosensory computing applications. They can include physiological (e.g., ECG/PPG, EDA, EEG) and kinesthetic signals (e.g., accelerometry, eye gaze, facial expressions). Many inferences can be drawn about the person from these signals, including their activities, emotional and mental states, health, and even their identities, intentions, memories, and thoughts.  While generated by the person, biosensory data have important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of user-generated data. They are intimate yet leakable, precise yet ambiguous, familiar yet unverifiable, and have limited controllability. Therefore, responsible stewardship of biosensory data must be in place before the full potential of biosensory computing can be realized.  This multidisciplinary course will explore the intellectual foundations and research advances in biosensory computing. We will survey the range of biosensing modalities and technologies, study temporal and spectral data analysis and visualization techniques, interrogate the designs of novel biosensing applications, and tackle issues of user privacy and research ethics. Students signing up for the 3-unit option will continue in the second half of the semester with a student-led research project.",

NLP is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on both linguistics and computer science, and helps drive much contemporary work in text analysis (as used in computational social science, the digital humanities, and computational journalism). We will focus on major algorithms used in NLP for various applications (part-of-speech tagging, parsing, coreference resolution, machine translation) and on the linguistic phenomena those algorithms attempt to model. Students will implement algorithms and create linguistically annotated data on which those algorithms depend.",

Our particular field of application is human rights, but this approach is broadly transferable to other areas of law and client-facing work in the fields of data science, public policy, and other social sciences.  GRIL students utilize data-driven and technological advancements for groundbreaking legal advocacy strategies. Serving organizational clients — grassroots organizations, national and international public interest and human rights groups, GRIL provides advocacy support and strategies to forge new pathways to address human rights challenges. GRIL clients want to harness data analysis, data science, and visualization to advance human rights investigations, litigation before national and international courts, or social justice policy advocacy.",

They will learn to critically evaluate AI tools to identify their value in UX workflows, articulate informed perspectives on emerging debates in UX for AI (e.g., how AI is redefining design and product roles), and make thoughtful decisions about when to delegate tasks to AI versus keeping them human-led.  Learning activities include hands-on use and structured evaluation of leading AI-enabled design tools (e.g., Figma Make, Lovable, V0), analysis and discussion of current academic and industry literature (e.g., how generative AI challenges the foundations of human-centered design), and conversations with industry experts building AI products. The course emphasizes cultivating an intentional exploration mindset — learning by researching, building, testing, and reflecting — to align emerging AI capabilities with human-centered design values.",

It explores how large language models (LLMs) work by guiding students through the complete model lifecycle: from core building blocks like embedding representations, attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures to adaptation techniques including in-context learning, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).  The course also explores advanced topics such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic reasoning systems, and multimodal learning that extends beyond text to incorporate vision and other data modalities.  Programming assignments, research paper readings, and a team-based final project will help students develop the technical proficiency to design, implement, and evaluate GenAI pipelines using Hugging Face, LangChain, and other open-source LLM APIs, while critically assessing their capabilities, limitations, and responsible use in real-world applications.",

Class sessions will simulate professional design practice through weekly critiques, peer feedback, and design reviews. Students will be expected to present their work every week, engage actively in discussion, and refine their designs based on input.  Assignments will range from rapid, low-fidelity exercises to more developed interaction prototypes, giving students practice across the spectrum of design methods. The course culminates in a final project during the last weeks, where students bring together the skills, approaches, and insights developed throughout the semester. By the end of the course, students will have built a portfolio project and gained experience working within the collaborative, iterative culture of interaction design.",
